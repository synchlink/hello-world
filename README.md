# hello-world
hello world tutorial.
I decided to follow the rest of the tutorial and change stuff. I am Jesse I am a student majoring in computer science. I have been interested in computers since I was at a young age. I took a long break from doing computer related stuff at 17 but now I'm coming back and I'm ready to learn again.
I edited the hello-world readme-edit branch's README.md file in order to include changes.
